# Active Learning with SVMs

During the summer 2010, I visited for three months the [Biocircuits Institute](http://biocircuits.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](http://ucsd.edu/) for an internship under the supervision of [Dr. Ramón Huerta](http://biocircuits.ucsd.edu/huerta/).

I developed an active sampling algorithm for [Support Vector Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) by defining an uncertainty measure based on the [Platt’s approximation of the conditional probability to the SVMs](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.41.1639&g). See [poster]( {% include view_online.html url='https://github.com/jgrizou/poster_internship_2010_active/releases/download/printed/poster_internship_2010_active.pdf' %} ).


I later used similar ideas to [devise experiments in crystallization experiments in a Chemistry lab]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/chemobot#human-vs-robots).
