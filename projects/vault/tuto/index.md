# How a self-calibrating interface works

Last update: August 2019

*Videos and interactive explanation of self-calibrating interfaces.*

## What is this about ?

Make sure you checked the [vault project page](../) or the [demo page](../demo) before.

To explain how a self-calibrating interface works, I have designed a window into its machinery as a side panel. That way you will get to see what is happening under the hood while you use the interface.

## Tutorials

Each tutorial is made of an interactive web application and a video explaining how to use it.

- [Two buttons](./1x2)
- [3x3 buttons](./3x3)
- [Touch](./touch)
