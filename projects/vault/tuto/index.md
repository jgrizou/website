# How a self-calibrating interface works

Last update: August 2019

*Videos and interactive explanation of self-calibrating interfaces.*

## What is this about ?

A self-calibrating interface is able to understand what you are trying to do, without knowing in advance how you are trying to do it. Imagine the remote control of your TV, but you get to decide what each button on the remote does while you are using it.

I know, that explanation is not really clear, and does not give you the feel of it. So I have crafted a self-calibrating code entering interface for you to try.

But more than trying, you will get to see what is happening under the hood and understand how it works.

## Tutorials

Each tutorial is made of an interactive web application and a video explaining how to use it.
