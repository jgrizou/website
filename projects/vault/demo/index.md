# Try a self-calibrating interface

Last update: August 2019

*Get your hands on a self-calibrating interfaces.*

## What is this about ?

A self-calibrating interface is able to understand what you are trying to do, without knowing in advance how you are trying to do it. Imagine the remote control of your TV, but you get to decide what each button on the remote does while you are using it.

I know, that explanation is not really clear, and does not give you the feel of it. That is why I have crafted a self-calibrating code-entering interface for you to try.

## Available interfaces

Different modalities can be tested, you can click on buttons, place points, draw sketches or even speak. If this is your first time, I recommend going through each version in order.

{% include vault_quick_access.html %}

For each version, a small explanatory text is provided along with a didactic video.

<p style="font-size: 0.75rem;">Btw, the audio version can be especially entertaining as you can replay previous recordings in ludicrous ways.</p>
