# Mind reading user interface

Last update: August 2019

*An online application to demonstrate the concept of self-calibrating interfaces.*

## Teaser

Let me show you another way to interact with your digital devices.

We will see various way to enter a password into an online interface.

A classical interface is designed explicitly to remove all user choices about how to use the interface. The goal of the designer is to constraint and funnel you into one way of behaving. The aim is efficiency and convenience for most users and judged by the convenience of todays app like Instagram or Twitter, the job has been well done.


You are asked to enter passwords every day, for online banking, shopping or emailing. The password entering interfaces are constantly improved to prevent hackers to steal your identity online. And the way these interface are designed is forcing us to used them in one unique and standardized way.

Here, I will show you another way.

For example, this is my bank password interface. To enter my code, I have to click on the digits in order. To make it safe, they change the order of the digits on the grid every time I login such that an attacker cannot infer my code from the position of my mouse.
