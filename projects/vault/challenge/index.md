# Open Vault Challenge

Last update: August 2019

*Can you crack the code of the vault?*

The vault is secured by a 4 digit code. But you are in luck, I video recorded my-self while entering the code, and I am giving you access to these videos!

So all you have to do is watch the videos, crack the code, and enter it yourself. Easy right?

## Levels

The challenge is split into levels of increasing complexity. I recommend starting with level 1, level 0 is optional if you get stuck at level 1.

- [Level 0](./level-0) - Optional starting level
- [Level 1](./level-1) - Two colored buttons
- [Level 2](./level-2) - Two colored buttons but something is weird
- [Level 3](./level-3) - 3x3 buttons, colors revealed
- [Level 4](./level-4) - 3x3 buttons, colors not shown
- [Level 5](./level-5) - practice with drawings
- [Level 6](./level-6) - practice with audio
- [Level 7](./level-7) - no buttons ?!

*Levels have been designed to provide a smooth challenge for all. If you feel confident, start with level 1, then jump to level 4, and directly proceed to level 7. These levels represent conceptual milestones, the other levels are designed to prepare players or demonstrate interesting use-cases.*
