# Now

Working on an [interactive paper to explain self-calibrating interfaces](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExWC2IDRwSTDM3E_KOHTg1AtcucBwccSggV3tad3ciA/edit?usp=sharing) (comments welcomed directly in the document). 

Developing [SpyLock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grizai.android.spylock) to understand product development and marketing.

# Highlights

Worth a read:

- [Interactive introduction to self-calibrating interface](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExWC2IDRwSTDM3E_KOHTg1AtcucBwccSggV3tad3ciA/edit?usp=sharing) (work in progress, comments welcomed in the document)
- [A curious formulation robot enables the discovery of a novel protocell behavior](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay4237)


My favorite projects:

# Previously

Research fellow at [CRI Collaboratory](https://research.cri-paris.org). Led a team of 9 researchers in the [Cronin Group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/) on the [digitization of Chemistry](projects/chemobot) and co-founded [Pollen Robotics](https://www.pollen-robotics.com/) to commercialize an innovative [modular robotic technology](https://www.luos.io/).

More broadly, I enjoy making things work in the real world. I devise AI algorithms, build robots, and develop web services. I bloom when leading innovative teams.
