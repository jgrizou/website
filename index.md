I am a Lecturer / Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Glasgow.

My research focus on developing tools to assist people in their creative process. We study what creativity is, how it can be measured and how it can be implemented algorithmically (ML/AI). Most importantly to me, we ask how the lessons learned from the above can inform the development of tools that effectively enhance the creativity of their users.

I have a keen interested in STEAM education, the history of technology and in collaborating with artists.

Feel free to [contact me](/about/), I like to learn new things.

# Now

I am focusing on writing research proposals at the moment.

Also writing publicly an [interactive paper to explain self-calibrating interfaces](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExWC2IDRwSTDM3E_KOHTg1AtcucBwccSggV3tad3ciA/edit?usp=sharing) (comments welcomed directly in the document)

# Highlights

Worth a read:

- [Interactive introduction to self-calibrating interface](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExWC2IDRwSTDM3E_KOHTg1AtcucBwccSggV3tad3ciA/edit?usp=sharing) (work in progress, comments welcomed in the document)
- [A curious formulation robot enables the discovery of a novel protocell behavior](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay4237)


My favorite projects:

- [An interface that reads your mind](projects/vault)
- [Robotics and AI in a Chemistry lab](projects/chemobot)
- [Self-calibrating interfaces: an intriguing AI paradigm](projects/thesis)
- [Open source robotics](projects/open_robotics)


# Previously

Part of the London 15th cohort at [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/). Research fellow at [CRI Collaboratory](https://research.cri-paris.org). Led a team of 9 researchers in the [Cronin Group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/) on the [digitization of Chemistry](projects/chemobot). Co-founded [Pollen Robotics](https://www.pollen-robotics.com/) to commercialize an innovative [modular robotic technology](https://www.luos.io/). Exhibited [artist](art).

More broadly, I enjoy building things, including ML algorithms, robots, and web services. I bloom within interdisciplinary innovative teams.
