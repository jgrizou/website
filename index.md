# Now

I am a Lecturer / Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Glasgow.

My research focus on developing tools to assist people in their creative process. We study what is creativity, how it can be measured and how it can be implemented algorithmically (ML/AI). Most importantly to me, we ask how the lessons learned from the above can inform the development of tools that effectively enhance the creativity of their users.

Currently writing publicly an [interactive paper to explain self-calibrating interfaces](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExWC2IDRwSTDM3E_KOHTg1AtcucBwccSggV3tad3ciA/edit?usp=sharing) (comments welcomed directly in the document).

# Standing Invitation

I had the luck to acquire a large range of engineering skills and to (co-)found 2 start-ups.  I like to share my learning with curious minded people, as well as to advice companies. Feel free to [contact me](about) for any question.

# Highlights

Worth a read:

- [Interactive introduction to self-calibrating interface](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExWC2IDRwSTDM3E_KOHTg1AtcucBwccSggV3tad3ciA/edit?usp=sharing) (work in progress, comments welcomed in the document)
- [A curious formulation robot enables the discovery of a novel protocell behavior](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay4237)


My favorite projects:

- [An interface that reads your mind](projects/vault)
- [Robotics and AI in a Chemistry lab](projects/chemobot)
- [Self-calibrating interfaces: an intriguing AI paradigm](projects/thesis)
- [Open source robotics](projects/open_robotics)

# Previously

Part of the London 15th cohort at [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/). Research fellow at [CRI Collaboratory](https://research.cri-paris.org). Led a team of 9 researchers in the [Cronin Group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/) on the [digitization of Chemistry](projects/chemobot). Co-founded [Pollen Robotics](https://www.pollen-robotics.com/) to commercialize an innovative [modular robotic technology](https://www.luos.io/). Developed the [SpyLock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grizai.android.spylock) Android App to test and disseminate a new spy-proof code-pad. Exhibited [artist](art).

More broadly, I enjoy making things work in the real world. I devise AI algorithms, build robots, and develop web services. I bloom when leading innovative teams.

See my [project page](projects) for skills, [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathangrizou) for career record, and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=en&user=Fej-hGQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for academic record.
