# 404: Page not found

Sorry, I have misplaced that URL and it is pointing to something that does not exist.

{% include image.html src="/shake.gif" col='col-md-10' %}

<div align="center">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/" class="btn btn-outline-dark btn-lg" role="button" aria-pressed="true"><span class="fas fa-home"></span> Back Home</a>
</div>
