## Active Sampling with SVM

During the summer 2010 and as an internship student, I visited for three months the [Biocircuits Institute](http://biocircuits.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](http://ucsd.edu/). Under the supervision of [Dr. Ramón Huerta](http://biocircuits.ucsd.edu/huerta/), I developed an active sampling algorithm for [SVMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) by defining an uncertainty measure based on the [Platt’s approximation of the conditional probability to the SVMs](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.41.1639&g).
