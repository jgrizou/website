### Salamander Control Using Virtual Muscles

My Master's thesis project while at Biorob, EPFL. This project intended to model the interaction between muscle activation and body curvature for salamander locomotion. The final objective was to reproduce a swimming dynamic on the salamander robot, a nine segments bio-inspired robot capable of swimming and walking, by driving a musculoskeletal model with recorded electromyography.
