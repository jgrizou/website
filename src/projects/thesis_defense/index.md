## Thesis Defense

During my Phd studies, I investigated how a machine can be taught a new task from unlabeled human instructions, which is without knowing beforehand how to associate the human communicative signals with their meanings. The theoretical and empirical work presented in my thesis provides means to create calibration free interactive systems, which allow humans to interact with machines, from scratch, using their own preferred teaching signals. Among the possible applications, we notably developed [self-calibrated brain machine interfaces]({{"/publications/iturrate2015exploiting" | web_path}})
