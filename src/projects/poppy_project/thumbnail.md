### Poppy Project

Poppy is an open-source platform for the creation, use and sharing of interactive 3D printed robots. It gathers an interdisciplinary community of beginners and experts, scientists, educators, developers and artists, that all share a vision: robots are powerful tools to learn and be creative. The Poppy community develops robotic creations that are easy to build, customize, deploy, and share. We promote open-source by sharing hardware, software, and web tools.
