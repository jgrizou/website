 abstract = {Novel hypotheseses have been formulated such that curiosity-driven sensorimotor exploration could be organized as to maximize learning progress [9], [10], which is different from more classical hypothesis conceptualizing curiosity as a drive to maximize uncertainty of novelty. Yet, experimental setups designed so far in the literature do not allow to separate between these hypotheses. A major research challenge is thus to design experimental setups which could allow to confirm or invalidate individual hypotheses. In this paper, we make a step in this direction by presenting an exploratory study with humans designed to analyze and measure properties of curiosity-driven exploration of a priori unknown sensorimotor spaces. More specifically, we are interested in the relation between exploration and learning progress.},
