 abstract = {In this abstract, we address the problem of removing the need for calibration. We propose an algorithm that simultaneously calibrates the feedback decoder and executes in closed loop a sequential task only known by the user. Our method exploits task constraints, namely optimal policies, to hallucinate the meaning of the teaching signals and select the task with the lowest expected error. We report results from a HRI scenario and a BCI online experiments. The results show that the proposed method is able to learn good feedback models while solving the task efficiently without any calibration.},
