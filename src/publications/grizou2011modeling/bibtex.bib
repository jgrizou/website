 abstract = {This project intends to model the interaction between muscle activation and body curvature for salamander locomotion. The final objective is to reproduce a swimming dynamic on the salamander robot, a nine segments bio-inspired robot capable of swimming and walking, by driving the resulting musculoskeletal model with recorded electromyography. At first, it has been extracted kinematics of several salamanders from slow motion X-ray movies. Afterwards the musculoskeletal model architecture has been developed based on previous works and robot constraints. Then, using the Webots simulator, the model parameters have been optimized according to statistical electromyography and kinematics. Finally, the model has been succesfully tested on the salamander robot in the lab.},
