 abstract = {In collaborative tasks, displaying legible behavior enables other members of the team to anticipate intentions and to thus coordinate their actions accordingly. Behavior is therefore considered to be legible when an observer is able to quickly and correctly infer the intention of the agent generating the behavior. In previous work, legible robot behavior has been generated by using model-based methods to optimize task-specific models of legibility. In our work, we rather use model-free reinforcement learning with a generic, task-independent cost function. In the context of experiments involving a joint task between (thirty) human subjects and a humanoid robot, we show that: (1) legible behavior arises when rewarding the efficiency of joint task completion during human\textendash robot interactions (2) behavior that has been optimized for one subject is also more legible for other subjects (3) the universal legibility of behavior is influenced by the choice of the policy representation.},
