 abstract = {In this demo, we present a multimodal conversation system, implemented using a Nao robot and Wikipedia. The system was developed at the 8th International Workshop on Multimodal Interfaces in Metz, France, 2012. The system is based on an interactive, open-domain spoken dialogue system called WikiTalk, which guides the user through conversations based on the link structure of Wikipedia. In addition to speech interaction, the robot interacts with users by tracking their faces and nodding/gesturing at key points of interest within the Wikipedia text. The proximity detection capabilities of the Nao, as well as its tactile sensors were used to implement context-based interrupts in the dialogue system.},
