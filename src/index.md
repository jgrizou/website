## Current positions

I am a PostDoc within the [Cronin group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/). I am in charge of the Chemobot Team (4 post-docs, 3 PhD students, 1 Intern). We explore how robots and algorithms can become tools for the exploration and discovery of complex physicochemical systems. We take inspiration from the field of developmental robotics, with concepts such as goal babbling, intrinsic motivation, and maturational constraint, and apply them to the exploration of complex systems in the real world.

I am also a Co-Founder at [Pollen Robotics](http://pollen-robotics.com/en/) a young start-up developing a robotic ecosystem allowing to prototype a robot in 1 day, develop a robotic application in 1 week and enabling manufacturing at scale in 6 months.

## More

I [defended my thesis]({{"/projects/thesis_defense/" | web_path}}) titled “Learning from Unlabeled Interaction Frames” on October 24th 2014. I pursued my PhD at the [INRIA and Ensta-ParisTech Flowers Team](https://flowers.inria.fr/) where I investigated how to create calibration free interactive systems. I was advised by [Manuel Lopes](https://flowers.inria.fr/mlopes/) and [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/). I received the [''Prix Le Monde de la Recherche Universitaire'' 2015 for my thesis work]({{ "/projects/prix_le_monde/" | web_path }}).

I am a long time maker and an active member of the [Poppy project](https://www.poppy-project.org/), an open-source project providing tools to enable the creative exploration of interactive robots for science, education, and art.

I received the [''Prix Le Monde de la Recherche Universitaire'' 2015](http://www.lemonde.fr/kiosque/recherche/laureats/prix-recherche-laureats-2015.html) for my thesis work. Each year, this price is awarded to 5 young French scientists across all fields of science. [Cédric Villani](http://cedricvillani.org/) was chairing the jury.
