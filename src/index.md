## Short bio

I am a PostDoc in the [Cronin group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/). The group study the origins of life from different perspectives. I am particularly interested by the intersection of chemistry, robotics, and AI. We are currently studying [the properties of oil droplets as a function of their chemical composition via an automated evolutionary process](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/141208/ncomms6571/full/ncomms6571.html). In other words, a robot autonomously performs simple chemical experiments, analyses them, and, depending on its previous observations, selects which experiment is to be performed next.

I [defended my thesis]({{"/projects/thesis_defense/" | web_path}}) titled “Learning from Unlabeled Interaction Frames” on October 24th 2014. I pursued my PhD at the [INRIA and Ensta-ParisTech Flowers Team](https://flowers.inria.fr/) where I investigated how to create calibration free interactive systems. I was advised by [Manuel Lopes](https://flowers.inria.fr/mlopes/) and [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/).

I am also a maker and an active member of the [Poppy project](https://www.poppy-project.org/), an open-source project providing tools to enable the creative exploration of interactive robots for science, education, and art. In 2015, we founded an association called ["Des Robots En Baskets"](https://github.com/desrobotsenbaskets/docs) to promote robotics as a tool for transdisciplinary education at many levels.

Our PlosOne paper on self-calibrated brain-machine interface control using error-related potentials is [online](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131491). The code and the paper source are available online: [https://github.com/flowersteam/self_calibration_BCI_plosOne_2015](https://github.com/flowersteam/self_calibration_BCI_plosOne_2015)

This work is a direct application of my thesis work on learning from unlabeled instructions. See the [project page]({{ "/projects/self_calibration_bci/" | web_path }}) and [my thesis defense]({{"/projects/thesis_defense/" | web_path}}).

I am involved in the **[Poppy project](https://www.poppy-project.org/)**. I am maintaining open-source libraries for creating parametrizable robots.

**Libraries:** [[robotis-scad]](https://github.com/jgrizou/robotis-scad) [[segment-scad]](https://github.com/jgrizou/segment-scad)

**Robots:** [[poppy-ergo-jr]](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-ergo-jr) [[poppy-4dof-arm-mini]](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-4dof-arm-mini) [[poppy-multipod-mini]](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-multipod-mini) [[poppy-snake-mini]](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-snake-mini) [[poppy-4wheels-mini]](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-4wheels-mini)
[[poppy-dragster-mini]](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-dragster-mini)

I am currently developing a [web visualisation for one of our robot](http://poppy-project.github.io/poppy-ergo-jr/simulator/), allowing the community to discover our tools without access to a physical robot.
