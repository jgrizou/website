# P-Values

Below is listed a few links about p-values and the too famous p=0.05 'significance' threshold. But let's summarize with an [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1478/) comic first:

#### A quote:

“We are not interested in the logic itself, nor will we argue for replacing the .05 alpha with another level of alpha, but at this point in our discussion we only wish to emphasize that dichotomous significance testing has no ontological basis. That is, we want to underscore that, surely, God loves the .06 nearly as much as the .05. Can there be any doubt that God views the strength of evidence for or against the null as a fairly continuous function of the magnitude of p?”
