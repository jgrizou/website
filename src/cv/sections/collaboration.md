## Scientific collaborations

- I am working with [IÃ±aki Itturate](http://people.epfl.ch/inaki.iturrate) and [Luis Montesano](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~montesan/web/) for applying my work on calibration-free interfaces to brain-computer interaction. [[Related project]]({{ "/projects/self_calibration_bci/" | web_path }})

- I am working with Anna-Lisa Vollmer and [Katharina J. Rohlfing](https://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~rohlfing/website/data/index.html) to investigate the co-construction of interaction protocols in collaborative tasks with humans. We study how humans can deal with the problem of learning from unlabeled instruction introduced in my PhD dissertation. [[Related project]]({{ "/projects/coco_game/" | web_path }})

- I am working with [Samuel Barrett](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~sbarrett/) and [Peter Stone](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/) for applying my thesis work to the ad-hoc team multi-agent setting.
