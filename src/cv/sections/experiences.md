## Experiences

Oct. 2015 to present
: **Research Associate** ([Cronin Group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/), [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/), Scotland, UK).

    I am in charge of the Chemobot Team (4 post-docs, 3 PhD students, 1 Intern).\
    We explore how robots and algorithms can become tools for the exploration and discovery of complex physicochemical systems. Under the direct supervision of Prof. Lee Cronin, my responsibilities are to: set-up, coordinate and meet the team agenda, supervise, guide and support team members, present and advertise work to stakeholders and visitors, paper and grant writing, paper review.\
    In parallel, I pursue my own research project that required building a new robotic platform (6x more efficient than previous) to test various algorithms to explore the range of behaviours that can exhibit oil-in-water droplet systems.


Oct. 2014 to June 2015
:   **Postdoctoral Fellow** ([FLOWERS team](http://flowers.inria.fr/), [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/), France).

    Finalized our collaboration on [Brain-Computer Interaction]({{ "/projects/self_calibration_bci/" | web_path }}) ([PLOSONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131491)) and Multi-Agent Cooperation.\
    Started work on [legible robot motions]({{ "/projects/legible_motions/" | web_path }}).\
    *Advisors:* [Manuel Lopes](http://flowers.inria.fr/mlopes) and [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/).

Sept. 2014
:   **Visiting researcher** ([LARG](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/), [UT Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/), USA).

    I visited [Samuel Barrett](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~sbarrett/) and [Peter Stone](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/) for a collaborative work on [ad-hoc teams](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Papers/bib2html/b2hd-AAAI10-adhoc.html).

Oct. 2011 to Sept. 2014
:   **PhD studies** ([FLOWERS team](http://flowers.inria.fr/), [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/), France).

    Developed a novel algorithm for self-calibrated interactive systems.\
    Started three international collaborations (application to [Brain-Computer Interaction]({{ "/projects/self_calibration_bci/" | web_path }}), application to Multi-Agent Cooperation, implication for [Emergentist Semantics]({{ "/projects/coco_game/" | web_path }})).\
    Participated in international conferences and workshops.\
    Supervised Master and Internship students.\
    *Advisors:* [Manuel Lopes](http://flowers.inria.fr/mlopes) and [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/).\
    *Defense:* [{{ "/projects/thesis_defense/" | web_path }}]({{ "/projects/thesis_defense/" | web_path }}).\
    *Award:* [{{ "/projects/prix_le_monde/" | web_path }}]({{ "/projects/prix_le_monde/" | web_path }}).

Feb. to Aug. 2011
:   **Master's thesis** ([BIOROB](http://biorob.epfl.ch/), [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/), Switzerland).

    Modeling the salamander swimming gate with virtual muscles on a robotic platform ([http://biorob.epfl.ch/grizou](http://biorob.epfl.ch/grizou)).\
    *Advisors:* K. Karakasiliotis, J. Knüsel, and [A.J. Ijspeert](http://biorob.epfl.ch/page-36382.html).\
    *Award:* Best Master's Thesis.

Jul. to Sept. 2010
:   **Research intership** ([BioCircuits Institute](http://biocircuits.ucsd.edu/), [UCSD](http://www.ucsd.edu/), USA).

    Active learning using the Platt approximation of the conditional probability to the SVMs.\
    *Advisor:* [Ramón Huerta](http://biocircuits.ucsd.edu/huerta/).

Sept. 2009 to Feb. 2010
:   **Erasmus semester** ([DTU](http://www.dtu.dk/english), Denmark).

    Followed courses on intelligent systems, robotics, and computational neuroscience. Creation of an electronic circuit simulating a basic neuron reaction to excitation and inhibition.\
