## Personal Activities

- I am an active member of the [Poppy project](https://www.poppy-project.org/): participating in weekly meetings, maintaining the [poppy-openscad library](https://github.com/jgrizou/robotis-scad), and helping the community on the [forum](https://forum.poppy-project.org/).

- I am a founding member of an association called ["Des Robots En Baskets"](https://github.com/desrobotsenbaskets/docs) - promoting robotics as a tool for transdisciplinary education at many levels.

- I built a 3D printer based on the RepRap open-source project, one hexapod robot, and one two wheels drive robot as a research platform.

- I am a proactive supporter of the online courses initiative, especially [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). I am financially supporting them by enrolling in verified tracks, allowing more students to get free access to knowledge. An exhaustive list of attended courses is included at the end of this curriculum vit√¶.

- I practice squash and like backpacking.
