I am an independent thinker capable of undertaking hard tasks without hesitation. I learn quickly new methodologies and I often put forward innovative ideas.

I worked on my PhD thesis at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/) in the [Flowers Team](http://flowers.inria.fr/) headed by [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/). I was interested in building smarter, more adaptive, human-machine interfaces. I am now moving towards the field of self-organization and complexity.

I am also a maker and an active member of the [Poppy project](https://www.poppy-project.org/), an open-source project providing tools to enable the creative exploration of interactive robots for science, education, and art.
