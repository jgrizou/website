<!-- I am an independent thinker capable of undertaking hard tasks without hesitation. I learn quickly new methodologies and I often put forward innovative ideas. -->

I am a PostDoc in the [Cronin group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/), currently in charge of the Chemobot Team (4 post-docs, 3 PhD students, 1 Intern). We explore how robots and algorithms can become tools for the exploration and discovery of complex physicochemical systems. Under the direct supervision of Prof. Lee Cronin, my responsibilities are to: set-up, coordinate and meet the team agenda, supervise, guide and support team members, present and advertise work to stakeholders and visitors, paper and grant writing, paper review.

I am a Co-Founder at [Pollen Robotics](http://pollen-robotics.com/en/) a young start-up developing a robotic ecosystem allowing to prototype a robot in 1 day, build an application in 1 week and enabling manufacturing at scale in 6 months.

I worked on [my PhD thesis]({{"/projects/thesis_defense/" | web_path}}), titled “Learning from Unlabeled Interaction Frames”, at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/) in the [Flowers Team](http://flowers.inria.fr/) headed by [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/). I was interested in building smarter, more adaptive, human-machine interfaces. I received the [''Prix Le Monde de la Recherche Universitaire'' 2015]({{ "/projects/prix_le_monde/" | web_path }}) for my thesis work.

I am also a maker and an active member of the [Poppy project](https://www.poppy-project.org/).


<!-- I am currently a PostDoc in the [Cronin group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/). The group study the origins of life from different perspectives. I am particularly interested by the intersection of chemistry, robotics, and AI. We are currently studying [the properties of oil droplets as a function of their chemical composition via an automated evolutionary process](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/141208/ncomms6571/full/ncomms6571.html). We are now exploring the open-ended exploration of such systems and the role of the environment as an experimental variable impacting the expression of physicochemical systems. -->
