## Contact

This is a standing invitation ot contact me. I want to talk to you, you won't annoy me. I had the luck to acquire a few skills and I enjoy sharing what I learned as well as learning from curious minded people. Like many, I was once too shy to contact people, thinking I would annoy them. Fear not, I like getting email, hearing of new ideas and meeting new people.

You can reach me by email at <a href="mailto:jonathan.grizou@glasgow.ac.uk">jonathan.grizou@glasgow.ac.uk</a> or any links below. My social media handle is usually *jgrizou*.

## Thanks

A number of persons and institutions have been instrumental to my development:

- After my post-doc, I was awarded a fellowship by the [Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity](https://www.cri-paris.org/en)) (CRI) in Paris, France. Co-founded by [François Taddei](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Taddei) and [Ariel Lindner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariel-lindner-4ba8a/), the research Collaboratory welcomed me very openly, I taught for the first time to curious students and became an artist by exhibiting my work. I still wonder how they made all this possible within the same building.

- After my PhD, I joined the [Cronin Group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), a fabulous interdisciplinary lab in Glasgow, UK. [Lee Cronin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leroy_Cronin) trusted me to lead a team of 9 bright researchers working at the [intersection of Chemistry, AI and Robotics](../projects/chemobot). I still find hard to believe all we achieved together and the trust I was given.

- At the same period, we co-founded [Pollen Robotics](http://pollen-robotics.com/) with [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieulapeyre), [Pierre Rouanet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierrerouanet/) and [Nicolas Rabault](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-rabault-521ab833/). Two very talented engineers joined us, [Cyril Sagonero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyril-sagonero/) and [Simon Baudry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-b-73629254/), and I met [Mark Logan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-logan-b945806/) which became a mentor. A great adventure with a lot of learning as we faced the outside world together for the first time, I could not have envisioned this without them.

- I pursued a PhD in the [FLOWERS team](http://flowers.inria.fr/) at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/en/) and was wonderfully supervised by [Manuel Lopes](http://flowers.inria.fr/mlopes) and [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/). As a result my [thesis](../projects/thesis) was awarded a [national thesis price](../projects/thesis/#awards) by [Cédric Villani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9dric_Villani), which then led me to contribute to the [French report on AI](https://www.aiforhumanity.fr/en/). I also had the chance to collaborate with [Iñaki Iturrate](https://people.epfl.ch/inaki.iturrate) and [Luis Montesano](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/luis-montesano-del-campo) for work on BCI, and [Samuel Barrett](http://sam.barrettnexus.com/) and [Peter Stone](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/) at [UTAustin](http://www.utexas.edu/) for work on ad-hoc teams. I was given the freedom to explore my own ideas, it is simply invaluable.

- During my engineering studies, I had the luck to study abroad at [DTU](http://www.dtu.dk/english) (Denmark) where I met [Charles Capaday](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/44522/overview), do an [internship](../projects/active_learning) in the [BioCircuits Institute](http://biocircuits.ucsd.edu) at [UCSD](http://www.ucsd.edu/) (US) under the supervision of [Ramón Huerta](http://biocircuits.ucsd.edu/huerta/), and work on my [Master thesis](https://biorob.epfl.ch/grizou) in the [BIOROB](http://biorob.epfl.ch/) lab at [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/) (Switzerland) under the supervision of [Auke Jan Ijspeert](http://biorob.epfl.ch/page-36382.html). Those were my first experiences with research, and I now realise how lucky I was with them.

I wish to thank them all for their respective roles in my personal and professional development.

## Website

<!-- This website is meant for me to remember and archive what I have done and thoughts I had. It is also a way to quickly show and explain my work to interested persons.

I make my-self quite vulnerable at times with what I share, which I believe is important for a healthy society. Otherwise our peers can only see a distorted version of reality that can become stressful when wishing to contribute. I suffer from imposter syndrome as most, especially in academia where brain show-off and convoluted vocabulary always make you believe you can't join the fun. It is sadly similar in many corners of our lives. Trust yourself, you can do it. We are all smart and imperfect in our own ways. -->
