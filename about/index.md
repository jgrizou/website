## Standing invitation

<!-- inspired from https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/ -->

If you want to talk about any topic covered on this website or something I should know about, I invite you to contact me. Sharing is caring, I want to talk to you, you won't annoy me. I strongly prefer emails as a communication method. I limit relentlessly my social media usage, don't expect to find me there.

You can reach me by email at <a href="mailto:jonathan.grizou@gmail.com">jonathan.grizou@gmail.com</a> or any link below.

<!-- ## About this website

This website is meant for me to remember and archive what I have done and thoughts I had. It is also a way to quickly show and explain my work to interested persons.

I make my-self quite vulnerable at times with what I share, which I believe is important for a healthy society. Otherwise our peers can only see a distorted version of reality that can become stressful when wishing to contribute, or simply be. I suffered from this as everybody, especially in academia where brain show-off and convoluted vocabulary always make you believe you can't join the fun. It is sadly similar in many corners of our lives. Trust me, you can do it. We are all smart and imperfect in our own ways. -->

## Thanks

A number of persons and institutions have been instrumental to my career:

- After my PhD, I joined the [Cronin Group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), a leading Chemistry lab in the UK. In direct interaction with [Lee Cronin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leroy_Cronin), I lead a team of 9 bright researchers working at the [intersection of Chemistry, AI and Robotics](../projects/chemobot).

- At the same period, we co-founded [Pollen Robotics](http://pollen-robotics.com/) with [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieulapeyre), [Pierre Rouanet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierrerouanet/) and [Nicolas Rabault](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-rabault-521ab833/). Two very talented engineers joined us, [Cyril Sagonero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyril-sagonero/) and [Simon Baudry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-b-73629254/), and I met [Mark Logan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-logan-b945806/) which became a mentor.

- I pursued a PhD in the [FLOWERS team](http://flowers.inria.fr/) at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/en/) supervised by [Manuel Lopes](http://flowers.inria.fr/mlopes) and [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/). My [thesis](../projects/thesis) focused on developing a novel algorithm for self-calibrating interactive systems, which was awarded by a [national thesis price](../projects/thesis/#awards) by [Cédric Villani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9dric_Villani) (who later invited me to contribute to the [French report on AI](https://www.aiforhumanity.fr/en/)). During my PhD, I collaborated with [Iñaki Iturrate](https://people.epfl.ch/inaki.iturrate) and [Luis Montesano](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/luis-montesano-del-campo) for work on BCI, and [Samuel Barrett](http://sam.barrettnexus.com/) and [Peter Stone](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/) at [UTAustin](http://www.utexas.edu/) for work on ad-hoc teams.

- During my engineering studies at [INSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_national_des_sciences_appliqu%C3%A9es), I had the luck to study abroad at [DTU](http://www.dtu.dk/english) (Denmark) where I met [Charles Capaday](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/44522/overview), to do an [internship](../projects/active_learning) in the [BioCircuits Institute](http://biocircuits.ucsd.edu) at [UCSD](http://www.ucsd.edu/) (US) under the supervision of [Ramón Huerta](http://biocircuits.ucsd.edu/huerta/), and to do my [Master thesis](https://biorob.epfl.ch/grizou) in the [BIOROB](http://biorob.epfl.ch/) lab at [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/) under the supervision of [Auke Jan Ijspeert](http://biorob.epfl.ch/page-36382.html). Those were my first experiences with research.

I wish to thank them all for their respective roles in my personal and professional development.
